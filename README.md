## Voice Model Setup üé§

Download Piper voice models from the [official releases](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/releases).

Expected voice file structure:

```
voices/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en_GB-jenny_dioco-medium.onnx # English female
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en_GB-alan-low.onnx # English male
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ es_ES-mls_10246-low.onnx # Spanish female
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ es_ES-carlfm-x_low.onnx # Spanish male
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ca_ES-upc_ona-x_low.onnx # Catalan female
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ca_ES-upc_pau-x_low.onnx # Catalan male
```

The library searches for voices in:

1. `$VOICES_DIR` (if set)
2. `./voices/`
3. `../voices/`
4. `~/.piper/voices/`

## Audio Processing üéµ

The library automatically applies professional audio mastering:

- **Loudness normalization** (-16 LUFS)
- **High-pass filter** (80Hz) - removes low-frequency noise
- **Low-pass filter** (12kHz) - removes high-frequency artifacts
- **Silence removal** - trims quiet sections
- **Format conversion** - 48kHz 16-bit output

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Issues

**"Missing voice for language"**

- Download the required voice models from Piper releases
- Check that voice files are in the correct directory
- Verify file permissions

**"Piper error"**

- Ensure Piper is installed and in PATH: `piper --help`
- Check that voice model files aren't corrupted
- Verify text encoding (UTF-8)

**"ffmpeg mastering error"**

- Install FFmpeg: `ffmpeg -version`
- Check write permissions in output directory

**OpenAI API errors**

- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your OpenAI account has sufficient credits
